Notes:
Hey, this is my first formal sudmition of an acc project for a hackathon, so i been told to rly take time in the readme. I got recomeded to go w/ a freind to curcit island. There i joined slack and found out about many programs liek solder and highway. I finished Solder and it was rly fun. I learn alot abotu how to build and set up the structure of the Pcb, which aslo helped me here, and understood how much work goes into these. I started the hack-pad project on Monday so 2 June, but didn't start to do anything until June 4 or 5. I wanted it wo be simple, js following the toutorial while adding my own little things. I have added 6 switches, and a knob. The 6 switches you can set to be differnt keys like prtsc (screenshot) or open calc or just like some numbers so u can enter ur password quicker. The knob will be for like vol control. Doing the scematics and pcb was easy but i have no idea what im doing for the codeing. Like i know python and c++ but i just dont know where to start. I looked at the slack #hackpad and i got a basic idea for it. I think theres 2 ways u can code ts, one way is a type of python called MicroPython(KMK) and another way called(QMK), which is run on C++. I think ill code it in the KMK first, as the slack people said its easier. I might code it in QMK for the experance for my next project.w
