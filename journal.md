- Over the last few hours, I did a lot of work on my first intro project, DuckPad.
- I finished the PCB for the DuckPad and started designing the top and bottom cases in Fusion 360. Currently, DuckPad has 6 switches and 2 LED lights. I also tried to add a potentiometer, which I connected to the A0 analog pin on the XIAO board. I still need to troubleshoot that part, but hopefully, I’ll get it working and submit it soon.
- Since I had never used Fusion 360 before, I had to download it and actually learn how to use it. It was a bit hard to get used to the controls at first, but eventually, I got the hang of it.
- I finished the case design and also started setting up the GitHub repository to organize my files and code.
- I attended the meeting and got clarification on some questions I had. I also got a lot of ideas for the next steps, both for DuckPad and for my upcoming project.
- I’ve started thinking about the code for DuckPad and trying to understand what I need to do to bring it all together.
- My goal is to finish DuckPad by June 5, and then start working on my next project, which is called Candle :)

- I have found out that my potentiometer does not work like i wired it to be. So i have changed it io the right one, a Rotery Encoder. It was a small switch and i got the case to be samller as well. Because I am printing the case myself, thats good.
- I have also started on the code. Its rly weird rn, bc im js trying to learn how to do it, but by tn, it should be done and submitted (hopefully)
